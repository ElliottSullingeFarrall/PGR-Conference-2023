# Abstract

The calculus of variations is an area of analysis that predominantly focuses on
the optimisation of functionals (functions that map functions to scalars) by con-
sidering the effects of making small changes (variations) to functions. This leads
to much more complexity than that of the ’standard’ calculus, where we can
simply just find zeros of derivatives. In the calculus of variations, great care has
to be taken regarding the spaces of functions that we consider.

We will begin this talk with an exploration of some of the key concepts in the
calculus of variations, including variational methods and the direct method. We
will establish some definitions of convexity that are commonly used in the field
and discuss their relevance to the direct method. We then move onto more
current developments in the area of optimising polyconvex functionals.
Such functionals are related to the so-called ’excess’ functionals that arise from
optimising the Dirichlet energy functional under certain boundary conditions
(Bevan 14). The study of polyconvex functionals is of great interest in the area
of elasticity (see Open Problems in Elasticity, Ball 02) and features many un-
solved problems that seemingly do not yield to the standard methods in the field.

In particular, we will establish conditions for a certain parameterised family
of polyconvex functionals to have a global minimum. The functionals we will
be considering do not meet the usual conditions to be treated by the direct
method in the calculus of variations and so we will make use of other techniques
including numerical approximations, partial differential inclusions and Fourier-
type analysis. We will develop several techniques for solving PDIs and evaluate
the benefits of these methods in relation to analysing the functionals under
consideration. Overall, we will obtain bounds on a parameter in both the cases
of sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of a global minimiser.
